The rules of Wordle are elegantly simple.

Your objective is to guess a secret five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.

To submit a guess, type any five-letter word and press enter.

All of your guesses must be real words, according to a dictionary of five-letter words that Wordle allows as guesses. You can’t make up a non-existent word, like AEIOU, just to guess those letters.

As soon as you’ve submitted your guess, the game will color-code each letter in your guess to tell you how close it was to the letters in the hidden word.

A gray or black square means that this letter does not appear in the secret word at all
A yellow square means that this letter appears in the secret word, but it’s in the wrong spot within the word
A green square means that this letter appears in the secret word, and it’s in exactly the right place
Getting a green square or yellow square will get you closer to guessing the real secret word, since it means you’ve guessed a correct letter.

For example, let’s say you guess “WRITE” and get two green squares on the W and the R, and gray squares for the I, T, and E. Your next guess might be WRONG, WRACK, or WRUNG, since these words start with WR and don’t contain the letters I, T, or E.

Alternatively, let’s say you guess “WRITE” and get two green squares on the T and the E, and gray squares for the W, R, and I. In that case, your next guess might be BASTE, ELATE, or LATTE, since these words end with TE and don’t contain the letters W, R, or I.

Remember that the same letter can appear multiple times in the secret word, and there’s no special color coding for letters that appear repeatedly. For example, if the secret word is BELLE and you guess a word with one L and one E, Wordle won’t tell you that both those letters actually appear twice.
